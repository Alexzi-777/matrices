# Matrices

In one of my robotics class, they expected us to already know matlab despite not required before enrolling. In spite of this, we had the option to code in c++, which I was studying in at the time. This is a rather archaic way of multiplying two matrices of the same dimensions, and stores no long term data. It simply outputs the results to the terminal and then terminates. While better than typing it in to my TI-84, I think this program was only used for one lab before I decided I needed to learn some matlab.
